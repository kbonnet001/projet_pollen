## 📄 This project in short
This project explores various alternatives to the inverse kinematics solution implemented by Pollen Robotics, aiming to manage the robot's constraints and limitations. 
The Pinocchio and Pink libraries are used to carry out this work. Among the proposed solutions, the QP-based approach with barrier integration shows promising potential.
