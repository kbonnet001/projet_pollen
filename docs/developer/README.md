# ðŸ“– Developer documentation

{path} correspond to the localisation where the folder projet_pollen has been installed. Our recommanded installation location is "/home/reachy/dev/reachy2_symbolic_ik/src"

## Function Testing
To test the implemented functions, a set of test functions is included in:

ðŸ“‚ **`{path}/projet_pollen/src/test_movement_test.py`**

This file, largely inspired by **`movement_test.py`**, includes:

**`test_sphere`**: Evaluates the effectiveness of spherical barriers.
**`make_spiral`**: Create a spiral with an increasing radius with Reachy's hand.
**`move_q`**: Give goal_position according to a movement Reachy could do by using only the selected q. (Attention: if the other joints aren't blocked in place with the variable blocked_joints, they will move to reach the end_goal, preventing the robot to move only the desired joints.)

To acccomplish those tasks, this file will call the ðŸ“‚ **`{path}/projet_pollen/ik_methods_tool.py`** file.
This file contain function to communicate and simplify the use of various ik methods, by including :

**`load_model`**: Loads the required URDF model for Pinocchio or Pink.
**`get_joints from_chosen_method`**: Call upon the chosen ik method with correct treatement of data to obtain the result of the inverse kinematics result.
**`get_current_joints`**: Get the current joints of the robot.


## Inverse Kinematics Methods
ðŸ“‚ **`{path}/projet_pollen/ik_methods.py`**

This file contains the programmed inverse kinematics functions for Pinocchio and Pin. The functions below may eventually replace symbolic_inverse_kinematics_continuous in:

ðŸ“‚ **`/home/reachy/dev/reachy2_symbolic_ik/src/reachy2_symbolic_ik/control_ik.py`**

**`symbolic_inverse_kinematics_continuous_with_pinocchio`**: Solves inverse kinematics using Pinocchio, without constraint handling.
**`symbolic_inverse_kinematics_continuous_with_pink`**: Solves inverse kinematics using the QP method with Pink.
**`symbolic_inverse_kinematics_continuous_with_pink_sphere`**: Solves inverse kinematics using the QP method with Pink, integrating spherical barriers at the end-effectors.
**`symbolic_inverse_kinematics_continuous_with_pink_V2`**: Solves inverse kinematics using the QP method with Pink, integrating both the previous spherical barriers and some other modification like correcting the joint and velocity constraint.

## Metrics and Visualization
These functions utilize:

ðŸ“‚ **`compute_metrics.py`**: Computes various performance metrics.
ðŸ“‚ **`CSVLogger.py`**: Saves metrics into a CSV file.
ðŸ“‚ **`plot_metrics.py`**

Several plotting functions are available to analyze the inverse kinematics resolution:  

### Joint Angles and Velocities  
- **`plot_q`**: Joint angles at each iteration.  
- **`plot_velocity`**: Derivative of joint angles over time for each iteration.  
- **`plot_velocity_std`**: Standard deviation of joint angle derivatives over time (computed over the last 10 iterations).  

### Differences Between Iterations  
- **`plot_ecart_q`**: Difference between the joint angle vectors at **t = i + 1** and **t = i** for each iteration.  
- **`plot_ecart_pos_rot`**: Difference between positions (quaternions) at **t = i + 1** and **t = i** for each iteration.  

### Trajectory and Goal Comparison  
- **`plot_translations_and_draw`**:  
  - Plots **x, y, and z** positions for each iteration.  
  - Displays the drawn trajectory.  
  - Optional parameters:  
    - `plot_goal=True`: Compares the result with the true goal.  
    - `plot_pollen=True`: Compares the result with Pollen's current resolution.
