## üìà Analysis of results

**Qualify** and **quantify** your achievements. Make measurements from your work, e.g.:

* **User tests**: Setup a methodology to test the efficiency of your project against users. It may use pre-experiment and post-experiment questionnaires. The most users the better to draw meaningful conclusions from your experiments. Radar diagrams are good to summarize such results.
* **Table of data**: Provide (short) extracts of data and relevant statistics (distribution, mean, standard deviation, p-values...)
* **Plots**: Most data are more demonstrative when represented as plots. 

Draw conclusions, **interpret** the results and make recommandations to your client for your future of the work.
It is totally fine to have results that are not as good as initially expected. Be honest and analyse why you did not manage to reach the objectives.
